    "## Academic Course Registration System\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project focuses on creating an Academic course Registration system by searhing courses, which is done by using Binary search tree method. It also gives administrative control to manage courses like to insert a course and delete a course ...e.tc . This systmem aims to manage the registration of students for different courses available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project mainly concentrates to create a system using Binary search tree which can also be done using other search methods like linear search or arrays or linked lists. But when we compare we get a conclusion that Binary search tree is most efficient method to perform search method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the project we focus on :**\n",
    "1. User Authenitication for both students and adminstrator side.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**User can perform the below actions**\n",
    "1. Registering in a course.\n",
    "2. cancelation of registration.\n",
    "3. view Course details.\n",
    "4. Search for courses.\n",
    "5. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Admin can perform the below actions:**\n",
    "1. Adding a new ccourse.\n",
    "2. Removing a new course if strength is full.\n",
    "3. Alloting waiting list numbers to students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary search tree:\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized tree-based data structure that enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is widely used in applications requiring fast lookups and ordered data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Binary search tree contains nodes which is linked to some value.\n",
    "2. Each node is pointed to differnt nodes atmost.\n",
    "3. The node right to it is greater than the parent node.\n",
    "4. The node left to it is less than the parent node.\n",

    "### why BST is used??\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Efficient Searching\n",
    "- BST allows **O(log n)** time complexity for searching a course by **ID or name**, making it much faster than linear search in an unsorted list.\n",
    "- This is crucial when students need to quickly find and register for courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ordered Storage\n",
    "- Courses are automatically stored in sorted order, making retrieval easy.\n",
    "- In-order traversal can list courses in ascending order by ID or name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Fast Insertion and Deletion\n",
    "- Adding or removing courses (e.g., if a new course is introduced or a course is canceled) can be done efficiently in **O(log n)** time in a balanced BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Efficient Range Queries\n",
    "- If a student wants to find courses in a certain range (e.g., all courses between **\"CS101\" and \"CS150\"**), BST enables fast **range-based searches**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dynamic Structure\n",
    "- Unlike arrays, a BST dynamically adjusts as courses are added or removed, without requiring memory reallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Using Binary Search Tree:\n",
    "### 1. Unbalanced BST Issues\n",
    "- If the BST becomes unbalanced due to sequential insertions (e.g., courses added in sorted order), it can degrade to **O(n) time complexity**, making operations slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inefficient for Large Data:**  \n",
    "-Operations like search, insert, and delete degrade to O(n) in worst cases.\n",

    "## IMPLEMENTATION\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a data structure**\n",
    "    - Define a binary search tree for managing the courses.\n",
    "    - The node contains all the details of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Authentication**\n",
    "   - we are using user class from which both student class and admin class are inherited\n",
    "   - we take all the credentials from the users while registering and allow them to login.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Course management**\n",
    "    - The Admin can only access the course details\n",
    "    - Can create a new course with definite number of students for that course\n",
    "    - The new course added is added to the BST.\n",
    "    - Can remove a course at any instant if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Managing of students in course registration**\n",
    "    - The students have access to register for limited number of courses\n",
    "    - The students can view all the courses available.\n",
    "    - The students can cancel the registration.\n",
    "    - We are using queues to manage the number of students and also to give waiting list number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Academic registration system**\n",
    "\n",
    "    By integrating\n",
    "    - The Admin for inserting courses and deleting courses.\n",
    "    - Student registration for registering the courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Academic Registration System utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient course management and Queues for fair handling of waitlisted students. The BST ensures quick course search, insertion, and deletion, while Queues manage waitlists in a First-In-First-Out manner. This approach allows for an organized, scalable, and efficient registration process, providing students with a smooth experience for course registration and management.\n",
